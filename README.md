# The Simracer chronicles

- If you use a loadcell, you will never go to regular pedals again;

- If you use a direct drive wheel, you will never go to a belt driver wheel again;

- If you see it at 120FPS, you will never be able to play at 60FPS again;

- The secret practice: "What, are we going to Bathurst tonight? - Oh my, I haven't raced there for months, ok, Ill join for fun, god help me :)))" - Finishes first on practice, qualy and race, 25seconds ahead of the rest;

- The random car selector: "oh well, I really just want to have fun, it's all about fun, isn't it? Let me pick a random car here... oh, this one looks so cool! nice! I take this one today!" - Always 'randomly' picks the OP car for the track;

- There is the traditional and well known FOV police, more recently, a new generation of police is getting traction, the one that gets triggered by the word 'Fanatec', if you say 'Fanatec', the police will popout somewhere and tell you that Fanatec Quick Release flexes.

- The best track in the world, is always the track the game does not contain.

- Most common simracers quotes: "It should have/be/add ...", "We want", "They should".

- The first lap master: On qualy, P22, on race, on first lap, first corner, P6 already! Damn!!!! why are they so slow?! why they brake so early. - After crashing a few corners later and taking 7 other cars with him. "I'm gonna uninstall this game!!!"
He wont uninstall, you can find him the same minute at some other monza lobby.

- I love the <s>porsche</s>, <s>mercedes evo</s>, <s>ferrari evo</s>, <s>bentley</s>, <s>mclaren</s>, current_op_car I always loved it, since I was a kid.. it is just a race car, it feels like it.

- The immersion master: if you don't use cockpit view, what are doing on a simulator! 
He himself don't uses the car dash, rather uses a middle screen gear indicator, closer to the windscreen than granny and sitting higher them the empire state building, with an angle that he can see the cars that follow him by looking trough the bottom of the car.

- "Who's at fault here?" videos are the last hope of dodgy moves approval.

- The German spell: One guy starts to speak German. In a moment the entire server starts to speak only German.

- sorry means: please don't report me.

- game gets new tracks, users: we need WAY more cars, if you released nothing but cars for the next two years noone would complain.

- game gets new cars, users: we need WAY more tracks, if you released nothing but tracks for the next two years noone would complain.

- We need more cars! On race day, everyone is on the OP car making most of the grids a single-make race.
